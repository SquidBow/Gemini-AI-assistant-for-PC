# SquidBow-Gemini-AI-assistant-for-PC

This is a simple AI assistant for PC, which can be used to control your computer using natural language. It is built using Python and uses the Google API key to generate responses.

Code created by copilot and not by me.

the AI assistant can do the following things:
- Create, read, edit and delete files and folders.
- See images.
- Search for files and folders. (Everything is needed for this)
- Execute scripts.
- Search the web for images videos or web pages.
- Scrape these webpages and images. (Use at your own risk)
- Download files from the web.

You can easily add more features to the AI assistant by adding more functions to the "functions" folder. Put a python file with the nesecary function, and AI will be able to use it as a function call, the code will automaticly detect.

Be carefull and don't try to make AI evil or smth, because it could lead to some small issues, like all the files from your C:/ or other drive being deleted (personal experience).
